I. **The Quantum Bottleneck**: Radiation-Induced Decoherence While thermal noise is managed via dilution refrigerators, ionizing radiation (X-rays and cosmic rays) remains a primary driver of correlated errors in superconducting qubits. To achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing, it requires integrated, high-attenuation shielding that operates at milli-kelvin temperatures without introducing electromagnetic interference. <br>
II. **Intellectual Property**: The "Mantel" Innovation My research led to a provisional utility patent (No. 63/567538) for "Mantel," a thin-film, multi-layered nanomaterial designed to block high-exposure X-ray and Gamma radiation. My work at LANL and Fordham provided the foundation for this technology, focusing on:<br>
•	High-Z Integration: Loading heavy-atom clusters into stable matrices.<br>
•	Cryogenic Stability: Ensuring structural integrity under extreme thermal cycling.<br>
•	Scalable Synthesis: Applying automation and ML-driven data analysis to accelerate material discovery.<br>
III. **Proposed Research**: Metal Oxide-2D Hybrids I propose to evolve the "Mantel" architecture by integrating the Group’s expertise in Liquid-Phase Exfoliation (LPE) and metal oxide nanosheets.<br>
1.	Nanostructured Attenuation: By leveraging LPE to create high-aspect-ratio metal oxide "bricks" ,  we can develop "brick-and-mortar" structures that maximize photoelectric absorption.<br>
2.	Multifunctional Interfaces: I intend to investigate the surface functionalization of these oxides to ensure compatibility with superconducting circuit substrates, ensuring the shielding is non-conductive and non-magnetic.<br>
IV. Synergy with the Group & University of  <br>
The University offers a unique opportunity to synthesize these materials in the Lab and validate their performance on actual superconducting resonators.  Mastery of colloidal chemistry is the essential link needed to transform "Mantel" from a lab-scale prototype into a scalable coating for the next generation of quantum processors.
